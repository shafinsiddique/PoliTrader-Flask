# PoliTrader

PoliTrader is an online trading simulator in which instead of trading shares in companies, users can trade shares in 
POLITICIANS. The 'market price' of the politician is based on their sentiment on twitter. If the public is tweeting positively
about them, their market price goes up and if the public tweets negatively about them, their market price goes down.

The main purpose of this application is to provide young adults with an innovative and fun way of keeping up with current events.

PoliTrader is built using Python's Flask Framework. The sentiment analysis of tweets is done by using a text classification model. The model was trained using Sci-Kit Learn and NLTK, Python's natural language processing library.
